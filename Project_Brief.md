## Organisation

### Duration

*1 Week*

### Set-up

*Students need to be placed in groups for the project. Ideally, there would be at least 4 students in a group.*

## Learning objectives

*The project is designed to encapsulate everything that has been covered so far on the course.*

## Brief

### Overview

You will be working in small teams to create an educational game for a group of schools.

### Deliverables

- Functional MVP of your proposed solution
- Wireframes
- Presentation

### Problem Statement

The management team of the Hive group of secondary schools has noticed a lack of engagement in non-STEM subjects over the last two years. They would like to try and reverse this trend and have asked an external team to come up with a solution that places student enjoyment at the heart of the learning experience.

### Background Research

**Chief Executive Officer, Hive Foundation**

_”Whilst we understand that a comprehensive grasp of STEM subjects is increasingly important within a rapidly technologising society, we also believe all students need a well-rounded, holistic education so that they are able to explore subjects with confidence, retain key knowledge, and obtain high level skills such as critical thinking.”_

**Students**

_”Sometimes certain subjects rely on textbook work too much and this means that the lessons can feel the same.”_

_“I love learning about different topics but it feels like we have so many things to cover that I struggle to remember it all.”_

_“Lessons can often feel the same with teachers using the same activities repeatedly.”_

**Parents**

_”It’s hard to know what to focus on as a parent. Students seem to be overwhelmed with content and this leads to a lack of enjoyment.”_

_“It feels like a lot of fun is missing from the curriculum at the moment, my child used to love school but this seems to be changing.”_

**Teachers**

_“As things stand, a greater focus on STEM subjects has meant that there is less time available for us to spend on non-core subjects in particular. A result of this is that knowledge that students gain is often superficial and lacks depth.”_

_“With the frequency of lessons decreasing, one of the things that we are increasingly noticing is that students are struggling to retain the knowledge that they need.”_

**Department for Education Guidance**

See current guidance [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-framework-for-key-stages-1-to-4/the-national-curriculum-in-england-framework-for-key-stages-1-to-4#language-and-literacy) (section 7.1).

### Technical Guidelines

- Use version control & work in an Agile manner!
- Your repos should have excellent READMEs. See our [Writing READMEs guide](https://github.com/getfutureproof/fp_guides_wiki/wiki/Writing-READMEs) for details.
- Your work should make good use of the concepts we have covered so far on the course such as wireframes, working methodologies, logical reasoning, and programming fundamentals.
- Your MVP should make good use of the technologies we have covered so far on the course such as vanilla JS, Express API, Node, Git, and GitHub, you will also need to use existing knowledge on HTML and CSS. 
- Your project will need a front-end and a back-end.
- There is no requirement to deploy your project, but you may choose to do this if you wish.

### Presentation Requirements

- Prepare a 10 minute presentation covering the following topics *(this is alphabetical, not an appropriate delivery order!)*:

   - Purpose of Solution
    - Planning & Delivery
    - Live Demonstration
    - Technologies
    - Significant Code / Code you are proud of (include snippets!)
    - Challenges and Solutions
    - Future Features
    - What We've Learned

- There will be a 5 minute opportunity for Q&A after each presentation.

### Timeline
