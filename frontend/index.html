                <p>
                    The aim of this game is to teach Game Theory intuitively through a fun and
                    interactive medium. Put simply, Game Theory is the study of decision making
                    strategies, and in this game we challenge you to make decisions that can beat
                    the market under differing circumstances. Your aim: to make as much money as
                    possible!

                <p>
                    Each round of the game, you will be asked to choose whether to set a high price
                    or a low price for your product. The market will also set a price for its own
                    product. If you set a low price and the market sets a high price, you will make
                    a large profit, the market will make nothing and vice versa. If you both choose
                    to set a high price, you will both make a large profit, and if you both set a
                    low price you will both make a small profit. It is your job to consider how you
                    will set your price to make the highest revenue and beat the market.
